    <p>
        Welcome! iShariu is the best place to study, grow up and broaden your horizons. We’re happy you’re here.<br>
        <br>These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.<br>
        <br>When we say “services” in these terms, we mean iSariu’s services, apps, websites, and other products.<br>
        <br>When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.<br>
        <br>We also have a Privacy Policy and these other policies that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services. If you use our, iShariu’s Creator Terms of Service apply to that use. iShariu’s Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through iShariu, and iShariu’s Monetization Terms apply to any sales you make through iShariu.<br>
        <br>Together, these rules make iShariu possible, and they matter to us. If you believe others aren’t following them, please let us know by reporting it to us.<br>
    </p>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We provide services that allow you to study. Our services may also include access to certain software, features, and content, including items that you can purchase from us or others. Additional terms may apply to those purchases.</p>

    <section id="section2">
        <h2>Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians</h2>
        <p>By accessing our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country. We maintain a list of minimum ages around the world as a resource for you, but we aren’t able to guarantee that it is always accurate. If you are old enough to access our services in your country, but not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or legal guardian must agree to our terms on your behalf. Please ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child (who must meet the minimum age for your country) to use the services, then these terms also apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services, including purchases made by them. For more information on purchases, see “iShariu’s Paid Services” below.</p>

        <h2>Your iShariu account</h2>
        <p>To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a iShariu account. You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information.<br>
            <br>You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your iShariu account and that you enable two-factor authentication.<br>
            <br>You must always provide accurate information to iShariu and maintain the accuracy of the information associated with your account. We may assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you, and that any purchases made using your account were made by you.<br>
            <br>If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account. If your account is compromised or you no longer have access to your email account or phone number, we may not be able to restore your access to your account or the courses you’ve created.<br>
            <br>You agree not to license, sell, lend, or transfer your account, iShariu username, vanity URL, or other unique identifier without our prior written approval. We also reserve the right to delete, change, or reclaim your username, URL, or other identifier.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold">Your Content</p>
                <p>When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our services. This includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</p>
                <p>You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this section of these terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others’ use of your content.</p>
                <p>Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use iShariu. Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We don’t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license—which is a form of permission—to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and improving our services:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate your content in manners consistent with your use of the services. (For example, so we can store and display your content.)</li>
                    <li>Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if you’ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, so we can display your messages if you post them in certain courses or recommend that content to others.)</li>
                    <li>Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content. (For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)</li>
                    <li>Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended. (For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content if it is in breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or any applicable law or regulation, or if it creates risk for iShariu or negatively impacts the experience or interests of other iShariu users to continue to make it available.</p>
                <p>We welcome feedback on our services. By sending us feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold">iShariu’s content</p>
                <p>Our services include some content that belongs to us, such as the design of our apps and websites, our art and images, and content written by us. You may use our software as outlined in these terms. You may only use our trademarks (or other brand indicia) and copyrights as permitted in our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.

                <p style="font-weight: bold">Other content</p>
                <p>Other people’s content. Our services might also provide you with access to other people’s content. You may not use this content without that person’s consent, or as allowed by law. Other people’s content is theirs and doesn’t necessarily reflect iShariu’s own views. iShariu doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by iShariu users. We work hard to try to make iShariu a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot always prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that content. You may report content that you think violates any of our policies. We have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion.</p>
                <p>Third party features and content. Our services may also allow you to access third-party websites, features, apps, or other content. We provide you access only as a convenience to you, and are not responsible for the content or services available from these websites or resources.</p>

        <h2>Restrictions on your use of iShariu’s services</h2>
        <p>When using our services, you must comply with these terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you must only use the services for authorized and acceptable purposes.

            <li>Don’t use the services to do harm to iShariu.

    <section id="section9">
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>Your right to terminate. You’re free to stop using iShariu’s services at any time and for any reason. To terminate this agreement, you may delete your iShariu account through the Settings page in the iShariu app (the gear icon next to your username) and discontinue use of the services. Certain provisions of these terms will survive termination as outlined below in the “Survival” section.</p>
        <p>Disabling your account limits the processing of your personal information as described in our Privacy Policy. Disabling your account does not terminate this agreement.</p>
        <p>Our right to terminate. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and/or your access to some or all of our services with or without notice, at our discretion for any reason, or for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You breach these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or additional terms that apply to specific products.</li>
            <li>We’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or court order.</li>
            <li>We reasonably believe termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties.</li>
            <li>Your account has been inactive for more than two years.</li>
            <li>Continuing to allow your account to be active, giving you access to some or all services, or hosting your content creates risk for iShariu, other users, or third parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, we will give you advance notice if reasonable to do so or required by applicable law.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="section10">
        <h2>Appeals</h2>
        <p>We value transparency and work hard to give you context for the decisions we make.

    <section id="section11">
        <h2>Indemnity</h2>

    </section>
    
    <section id="section12">
        <h2>Services “AS IS”</h2>

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OR STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

    </section>
    
    <section id="section13">
        <h2>Data Charges</h2>

    <section id="section14">
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE BELOW TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE’RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR MATERIAL BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN’T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>
        <p>THE INFORMATION PRESENTED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES IS MADE AVAILABLE SOLELY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. WE DO NOT CONFIRM THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE INFORMATION. ANY RELIANCE YOU PLACE ON SUCH INFORMATION IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
        <p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, NEITHER iShariu, ITS AFFILIATES, NOR OUR SUPPLIERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT iShariu OR ITS SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
        <p>BESIDES THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), iShariu LIMITS OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID US IN THE THREE MONTHS BEFORE YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM OR (B) $100 USD (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN YOUR LOCAL CURRENCY).</p>
        <p>iShariu ISN’T LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF OUR SERVICES.</p>
        <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN iShariu AND YOU. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY DESCRIBED ABOVE SHALL APPLY FULLY TO RESIDENTS OF NEW JERSEY.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="section15">
        <h2>More important stuff</h2>
        <p>You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.</p>
        <p>Entire agreement. These terms cover the entire agreement between you and iShariu for your use of our services.</p>
        <p>Additional terms. Where additional terms apply to our products or services, the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that product or service to the extent of any conflict with these terms.</p>
        <p>Bug reporting. We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please visit https://ishariu.com/security.</p>
        <p>Export Control. You agree to comply with all applicable import, export, and re-export control laws and restrictions, including but not limited to those of the European Union and its member states, the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), and will not use the services to cause a violation of such laws or regulations. You agree to not use our services to store or distribute content that is subject to export controls, unless you have obtained all required government export authorizations. Further, you represent and warrant that you are not on any government list of prohibited or restricted parties, or otherwise subject to equivalent restrictions, as specified in the laws and regulations listed above or in your country’s laws. You may not download or use our services if you are located in a country or region subject to U.S. or E.U. government embargo (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region) unless that use is authorized by the United States and other relevant authorities.</p>
        <p>Waiver, severability, and assignment. If you fail to follow these terms and we don’t immediately act, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any of our legal rights (such as acting in the future). If any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with our services.</p>
        <p>Survival. Any part of these terms that by their nature should survive after termination of these terms will survive. As permitted under applicable law, this includes but may not be limited to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our rights to retain and display certain data;</li>
            <li>Any amounts owed will remain due;</li>
            <li>Any indemnification obligations (as applicable) such as those listed under the “Indemnity” section;</li>
            <li>Any disclaimer of warranties such as those under the “Services ‘AS IS’” section;</li>
            <li>Any applicable limitation of liability such as those under the “Limitation of Liability” section;</li>
            <li>Any dispute resolution provisions, including the arbitration agreement, such as those under the “Settling disputes between you and iShariu” section.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Updates to these terms. We may decide to update these terms: (1) to reflect changes to our services or our business, (2) for legal or regulatory reasons, (3) to prevent abuse on or of our services, or (4) to better protect or serve users of our services. If these changes materially affect your iShariu use or your legal rights, we’ll give you reasonable advance notice (unless the updates are urgent). If you continue to use our services after the changes have taken effect, it means that you agree to the changes. If you don’t agree, you must stop using our services.</p>
